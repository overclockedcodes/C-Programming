/*
ðŸ§  Line-by-Line Explanation
#include <stdio.h>

Includes the Standard Input/Output library for using printf and scanf.

int main()

The main function where execution begins.

int a, b, c;

Declares three integer variables to hold the numbers entered by the user.

printf(...) and scanf(...)

Prompt the user and read three numbers into a, b, and c.

if (a < b && b < c)

Checks if a is less than b AND b is less than c.

The && operator is the logical AND, which returns true only if both conditions are true.

printf(...) inside if and else

Prints whether the numbers are in ascending order or not.

return 0;

Ends the program and returns success.
